        Hi, I'm a Web Developer with experience in building web applications using a variety of technologies. I am skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, NextJs, and backend development with Laravel, PHP, and CodeIgniter 3. I also have
        experience working with MySQL, Firebase, and building RESTful APIs. For design, I use Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, and Material UI, along with design tools like Figma and Adobe XD. I'm familiar with Git/GitHub for version control and
        often use Vercel for deployment. For CMS solutions, I also work with WordPress Elementor.
